# Sprint Planning 

Date/Time Start: 11/28/2023

Participants: Joseph Tewolde, Bryan Thao, Sayizana Worku, Kentaro Mainieri, Christopher Long

Goal Statement: The goal the sprint is US#3 and US#4

Daily Scrum Summary:
  We were initally struggling to create a "create playlist" function while getting it recorded with the database. But it was soon solved by referencing previous works with Project 1. More testing was done and changes to the User Interface such as setting fucntions across the top the page for Users. US#4 was a bit harder due to some problems with implementation to create and was pushed towards Sprint #3 for some more time to formulate and testing.
